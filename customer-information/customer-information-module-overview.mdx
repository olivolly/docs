# Overview

The **Customer Information** module helps centralize and manage all customer account data used across DASH. The data here is important to ensure accurate order entry, pricing calculation, and shipping instructions. 

This module is frequently used by sales reps, customer service agents, accounting, and operations teams who rely on up-to-date customer data for decision-making and transaction processing.
