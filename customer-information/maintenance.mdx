# Overview

The **Customer Information** > **Maintenance** submodule helps you manage data that shapes customer records and behaviors in the system. This includes types, groupings, levels, and sales reps, all of which affect how customer accounts are organized and treated.

For example, if you create a new customer record in the Manage Customers submodule and do not find relevant Customer Types / Groups / Levels / Reps to label it with, the Maintenance submodule is where you can create and manage those attributes.

# What You Can Do

The Maintenance submodule contains the following tabs:

- **Customer Types:** segments accounts by their business type (e.g., retailer, distributor, chain) and category (e.g., art, craft, hardware, education).
- **Customer Groups:** used to define umbrella groups for larger customers with custom terms.
- **Customer Levels:** correspond to pricing tiers or price lists.
- **Sales Reps:** lists reps and their information, such as commission rate and contact details.

Each tab allows you to **`+ Add New`** data to the table, along with export data in a variety of formats.
