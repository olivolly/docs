# What is DASH?

**DASH** (Data Analysis and Systems Hub) is an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system by DecoArt that supports everything your company needs to run smoothly. It brings all aspects of your business - from finance and administration to inventory, manufacturing, sales, logistics, and quality control - into a single, connected platform. 

At its core, DASH helps your teams work form the same accurate data. Instead of switching between various tools, DASH gives everyone a shared system for managing parts, tracking orders, running work orders, handling financials, and more. 

DASH can be configured so that each team only sees what’s relevant to them. Whether you’re in accounting, customer support, or on the production floor, DASH will display the tools and information to help you do your job efficiently. 


# What Can DASH Help You Do?

- **Track and fulfill orders** - from the moment an order is created to the time it's shipped and invoiced.
- **Manage your parts and inventory** - know exactly what you have, where it is, and what it costs.
- **Run production smoothly** - create, monitor, and report on work orders and packaging jobs.
- **Stay on top of accounting** - handle accounts payable, receivable, journal entries, P&Ls, and more.
- **Coordinate purchasing** - create POs, manage vendors, and oversee inbound goods.
- **Schedule smartly** - plan out batches, dispersion, and shipping lanes.
- **Support teams across your company** - from administrators managing users and roles to warehouse staff using DASH on handheld devices for picking and packing.


# How Does DASH Work?

DASH is composed of several modules tailored towards specific tasks or teams, such as **Accounting** and **Work Orders**. Those modules form an interconnected system that communicates through a shared database. Your company’s users can be added to specific DASH modules according to their role.

When you sign into DASH, you’ll land on the **Dashboard.** The Dashboard shows a high-level overview of key information in your company drawn from across your modules.

**Note**

What you see in DASH depends on your role: 

- If you have an administrative or back-office role (e.g., accounting, sales, customer service), you’ll see the Dashboard and sidebar with access to your assigned modules.
- If you have a production floor role (e.g., order selector, material handler, work order operator), you’ll see a different interface on your handheld device without the Dashboard or sidebar.
