# What is DASH?

**DASH** (Data Analysis and Systems Hub) is an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system by DecoArt that supports everything your company needs to run smoothly. It brings all aspects of your business - from finance and administration to inventory, manufacturing, sales, logistics, and quality control - into a single, connected platform. 

At its core, DASH helps your teams work form the same accurate data. Instead of switching between various tools, DASH gives everyone a shared system for managing parts, tracking orders, running work orders, handling financials, and more. 

DASH can be configured so that each team only sees what’s relevant to them. Whether you’re in accounting, customer support, or on the production floor, DASH will display the tools and information to help you do your job efficiently. 


# What Can DASH Help You Do?

- **Track and fulfill orders** - from the moment an order is created to the time it's shipped and invoiced.
- **Manage your parts and inventory** - know exactly what you have, where it is, and what it costs.
- **Run production smoothly** - create, monitor, and report on work orders and packaging jobs.
- **Stay on top of accounting** - handle accounts payable, receivable, journal entries, P&Ls, and more.
- **Coordinate purchasing** - create POs, manage vendors, and oversee inbound goods.
- **Schedule smartly** - plan out batches, dispersion, and shipping lanes.
- **Support teams across your company** - from administrators managing users and roles to warehouse staff using DASH on handheld devices for picking and packing.


# How Does DASH Work?

DASH is composed of several modules tailored towards specific tasks or teams, such as **Accounting** and **Work Orders**. Those modules form an interconnected system that communicates through a shared database. Your company’s users can be added to specific DASH modules according to their role.

When you sign into DASH, you’ll land on the **Dashboard.** The Dashboard shows a high-level overview of key information in your company drawn from across your modules.

<Alert type="info" title="Note">
  What you see in DASH depends on your role:

  - If you have an administrative or back-office role (e.g., accounting, sales, customer service), you’ll see the Dashboard and sidebar with access to your assigned modules.
  - If you have a production floor role (e.g., order selector, material handler, work order operator), you’ll see a different interface on your handheld device without the Dashboard or sidebar.

# Core Concepts

## Parts

In DASH, **Parts** are the foundational units that connect nearly every module together, from inventory and production to purchasing, sales, and finance. 

A Part is any discrete item, product, or material that moves through the business. Parts can represent:

- Products sold to customers
- Components used in manufacturing
- Raw materials
- Packaging materials
- Work-in-progress (WIP) assemblies

Each Part is uniquely identified and holds critical data that helps the business operate effectively.

Almost every module connects back to Parts in some way. A Part might start in the system as a newly created Part, appear in an order, flow into a work order for production, show up in inventory and shipping, and ultimately get recorded on an invoice and in financial reports. 

## DASH’s Multi-Company Structure

DASH lets you manage multiple companies within a single system, while keeping their operations and finances separate.

Each company has its own configuration, processes, and visibility. This is useful for setups like:

- A parent company with multiple subsidiaries
- Companies with different accounting calendars or workflows

User access is permission-based. Some users may be able to switch between companies; others may only see one.

Companies can also be structured flexibly:

- Some acquisitions are set up as new companies
- Others are folded in as product lines under an existing company

Most importantly, all financial data - like journal entries and reports - is kept separate for each company.

## License Plates, Locations, and Inventory Management

DASH tracks inventory using license plates and location tags, which together tell you where each part is and how much of it there is.

- Location Tags describe the physical location of a part (e.g., warehouse, aisle, bin).
- License Plates are unique IDs tied to pallets. When scanned, they show what part is on the pallet, how much is there, and where it's located.

These IDs are used throughout DASH to manage inventory. For example, when a part is scanned for a work order, DASH automatically deducts that quantity from the correct location.

You can also run cycle counts to manually record the inventory on each pallet you're reviewing.

## Bills of Materials

In DASH, a Bill of Materials (BOM) lists all the components and quantities needed to manufacture a Part. You can think of it like a recipe for how to make a Part. 

Each BOM includes:

- A list of subparts and how many of each are required
- Whether each subpart is purchased or manufactured
- Estimates for material costs, labor costs, and production time

BOMs help DASH plan production, track efficiency, and manage costs. For example, if you're making 100 Parts, DASH calculates exactly how much of each component you need to produce them. 

BOMs are central to both manufacturing workflows and financial reporting.
